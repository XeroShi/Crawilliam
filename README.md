# Crawilliam (Another Sleep Deprived Project)
A Python based IP Grabber that utilizes Discord Webhooks.
It also features persistency (albeit, not *that* persistency!) 

## How does it work?
It uses Python 3 and IP-API to grab the user's information, parses it from JSON and send the information through Discord Webhooks.
The API used also includes Geolocation as well as the date. Once it grabs and posts the information, it goes into sleep for a set amount of time
before running again to update the information and sleep. 

## To-Do
* Better Persistence
* Cleaner Code
* Other things I cannot mention because I'm tired
* Fun Features
